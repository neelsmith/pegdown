# citedown #

This repository is a clone of the original [pegdown parser for parsing markdown using a PEG grammar][1]:  see the accompanying file `README-pegdown.md`.

citedown extends markdown with support for citation (external reference to a resource) and quotation (embedded content from a resource) of scholarly material identified by CITE URN.
