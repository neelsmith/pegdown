<p>The Aristotelian treatise known as the <a class="cts-text" href="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003" title="The Aristotelian text *Constitution of the Athenians*"><em>Constitution of the Athenians</em></a> (in Greek, Ἀθηναίων Πολιτεία) is most fully preserved on <a class="cite-collection" href="urn:cite:athPol:bm131" title="The physical artifact of the papyrus, today in the British Museum">a single papyrus, today in the British Museum</a>. The papyrus was originally composed of four numbered rolls: we can still still the numbers above the first column of <a class="cite-collection" href="urn:cite:fufolioimg:AthPol.131_1v_pano:0.171,0.0875,0.0105,0.0333" title="Number identifying scroll 1">roll 1</a>, <a class="cite-collection" href="urn:cite:fufolioimg:AthPol.131_3v_pano:0.0435,0.0353,0.01,0.0543" title="Number identifying scroll 2">roll 2</a> and <a class="cite-collection" href="urn:cite:fufolioimg:AthPol.131_4v_pano:0.0775,0.0768,0.0205,0.0237" title="Number identifying scroll 3">roll 3</a>. It is clear that the scribe did not have the entire text, since the first chapter of the extant work begins in the clearly labelled first column of roll 1, yet famously opens in the middle of a sentence:  see <a class="cite-collection" href="urn:cite:fufolioimg:AthPol.131_1v_1_col_1:0.0405,0.0384,0.8615,0.0697" title="Chapter 1 of Ath Pol">chapter 1 on the papyrus</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the original four scrolls are preserved in five large fragments: scroll 1 is split across two fragments. See the following panoramic views of the fragments:</p>
