The Aristotelian treatise known as the {*Constitution of the Athenians*}[2] (in Greek, Ἀθηναίων Πολιτεία) is most fully preserved on {a single papyrus, today in the British Museum}[1].  The papyrus was originally composed of four numbered rolls: we can still still the numbers above the first column of {roll 1}[3], {roll 2}[4]  and {roll 3}[5].  It is clear that the scribe did not have the entire text, since the first chapter of the extant work begins in the clearly labelled first column of roll 1, yet famously opens in the middle of a sentence:  see {chapter 1 on the papyrus}[6].

Today, the original four scrolls are preserved in five large fragments:  scroll 1 is split across two fragments.  See the following panoramic views of the fragments:

- {Fragment 1}[7]
- {Fragment 2}[8]
- {Fragment 3}[9]
- {Fragment 4}[10]
- {Fragment 5}[11]
